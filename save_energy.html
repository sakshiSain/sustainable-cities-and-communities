       <h2 style="font-size: 40px;">RAISING AWARENESS ON ENERGY SAVING</h2>
       <big><u><b>Small act when multiplied by millions of people can transform the world</b></u> </big>
       <p style="font-size: 15px;"> Sustainable Development Company, <b>Motiva</b>, has organized the national Energy Saving Week (5-11 October 2020) in <b>Finland</b>.
       <u>This year's topic focuses on how to identify equipment and systems that cause major energy consumption.</u>
       A major cause of high energy consumption in Finland is heating buildings. Reduction of room temperature even by one degree, can result in far more reasonable energy consumption. People must rethink their behaviour and make small changes to reduce the energy consumption.
       <br>
       During the Energy Saving Week, <b>Motiva </b>provided lots of information about energy saving and the possibilities for each person to make sustainable choices. Organizations that joined the Energy saving week campaign had a great opportunity to make behavioural changes and support energy savings in their organizations.</p>
