    <h2>REDUCE</h2><big>
<p>Understand what you truely value and need to but and use much less.
Reduce is to limit the amount of waste you create in the first place.
This includes buying products with less packaging and
choosing the most sustainable options.</p>
</big>
<hr>
    <h2>REUSE</h2><big>
<p>It means to use something again that you would normally throw away after a single use. 
When we reuse, we use fewer natural resources and also ,
save the energy that is needed to make the replacement.</p>
</big>
<hr>
    <h2>RECYCLE</h2><big>
<p>It means the product goes through a mechanical process to change its form. 
Recycling saves energy, resources and materials from creating brand new products.
Through the process of recycling the same product can be used multiple times in different forms,
which not saves natural resources but also protects our environment.</p>
</big>
<hr>
    <h2>RECOVER</h2><big>
<p>This means a safe and eco-freindly alternative should be used in place of a thing.
For example,using a clothing bag is used instead of a polythene bag. 
Most of the materials thrown in thw garbage can be used and 
processed inways other than being destroyed.
Such a process is called recovering.</p>
